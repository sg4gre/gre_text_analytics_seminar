Create a Conda environment with python 3.10.9

Then, install these packages from the environment manager:

matplotlib
notebook
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
scipy
spacy

We also need a package called "cleantext". We will install this directly from the python script. There should be a cell with the content: "!pip install cleantext". Make sure it's uncommented, that is make sure it does *not* start with "#".
